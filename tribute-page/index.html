            <p>Serbian-American engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) made dozens of breakthroughs in the
                production, transmission and application of electric power. He invented the first alternating current
                (AC) motor and developed AC generation and transmission technology. Though he was famous and respected,
                he was never able to translate his copious inventions into long-term financial success—unlike his early
                employer and chief rival, Thomas Edison.</p>
            <p>Did you know? During the 1890s Mark Twain struck up a friendship with inventor Nikola Tesla. Twain often
                visited him in his lab, where in 1894 Tesla photographed the great American writer in one of the first
                pictures ever lit by phosphorescent light.</p>

                Tesla studied math and physics at the Technical University of Graz and philosophy at the University of
                Prague. In 1882, while on a walk, he came up with the idea for a brushless AC motor, making the first
                sketches of its rotating electromagnets in the sand of the path. Later that year he moved to Paris and
                got a job repairing direct current (DC) power plants with the Continental Edison Company. Two years
                later he immigrated to the United States.
